Discription: Real-Time Chat Application

As an intern, I had the opportunity to work on building a real-time chat application that enables instant communication between users. The project involved using WebSockets for bi-directional communication between the client and server, ensuring that messages are delivered and received in real-time without the need for constant page refreshes or polling. On the frontend, I used React.js (alternatively, Vue.js can be used) to develop a dynamic and responsive user interface. The application features a modern chat UI that adapts well across various screen sizes and devices. I implemented message history functionality by integrating a backend API that stores and retrieves previous messages, providing users with context in ongoing conversations. One of the key deliverables was to ensure a responsive design with smooth message rendering, automatic scrolling, and real-time message updates. I also focused on maintaining clean code structure, reusable components, and proper state management using React Hooks (or Vue's reactive properties).
Overall, this project helped me understand the fundamentals of real-time web communication, frontend-backend integration, and responsive UI/UX design. It was a valuable learning experience that strengthened my development skills in modern web technologies.
