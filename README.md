Discription: Real-Time Chat Application

During my internship, I developed a real-time chat application using WebSockets for live communication and a modern frontend framework—either Vue.js or React.js—for building the user interface. The main objective of this project was to create a responsive and user-friendly chat interface that supports real-time message exchange along with message history.I used Visual Studio Code (VS Code) as the primary development environment, which helped streamline my workflow through extensions, integrated terminal, and debugging tools. The backend was responsible for managing WebSocket connections and broadcasting messages to all connected clients. On the frontend, I implemented features such as message input, live updates of conversations, and auto-scrolling of chat windows. A key deliverable of this project was the responsive design of the chat interface, ensuring usability across different devices like desktops, tablets, and smartphones. I also implemented message history functionality by fetching previous conversations from the backend and rendering them upon loading the chat window. This enhanced the user experience by preserving context in ongoing conversations.
Overall, this project helped me gain hands-on experience with WebSockets, state management in frontend frameworks, and responsive UI design, while improving my debugging and problem-solving skills in a real-world scenario.
